# Predicting Supplier Risk with a KNN Algorithm
![hero_image](https://github.com/DillonGelman/KNN-supplier-risk-classifier/blob/main/hero_image.png)

This project provides a simple K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) implementation for classifying supplier risk levels. Risk categories are assigned automatically based on configurable thresholds. You can now upload your own CSV data instead of relying on randomly generated samples.

## Usage
[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://gelman-supplier-risk.streamlit.app/)

The app generates sample data and will support file uploads in a future version. After the classification report, a live Seaborn pairplot of the predicted risk level is displayed for interactive exploration.
