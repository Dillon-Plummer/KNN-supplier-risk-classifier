# KNN-supplier-risk-classifier

This project provides a simple K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) implementation for classifying supplier risk levels. The dataset is generated synthetically and risk categories are assigned based on configurable thresholds.

## Usage

Run the classifier from the project root:

```bash
python src/knn_risk_classifier.py
```

The script outputs basic evaluation metrics and a classification report for the model.
